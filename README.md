Milestone Project2 - Memory Toad Game

##Introduction-

Welcome to my second Milestone Project called *'Memory Toad'* which will be showcasing my skills, learning and understanding that I have learnt through the course so far while being implemented into a front-end, user centric memory game.

Within this README, I will cover all the steps and planning processes used while creating this project, including where I gained my inspiration from and my main focuses as the developer. You can view my live project [here](https://laila-ba.github.io/Project2/)
