Milestone Project2 - Memory Toad Game

##Introduction-

Welcome to my second Milestone Project called *'Memory Toad'* which will be showcasing my skills, learning and understanding that I have learnt through the course so far while being implemented into a front-end, user centric memory game.

Within this README, I will cover all the steps and planning processes used while creating this project, including where I gained my inspiration from and my main focuses as the developer. You can view my live project [here](https://laila-ba.github.io/project2/)

During the planning process, I found the Elements of User-Experience to be helpful as it allowed me to keep in mind what the user wants and how my piece should respond to their actions. These elements are broken into 5 key stages:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

I began to conduct some research on what features a conventional memory game included in order to further understand what users would be expecting. I came up with a list of goals that I would want to achieve for my project:

*Creator stories*

  - As a creator, I want to create a positive user response throughout the project, following the principles of UX
  design and presents a structured layout and navigation model.
  - As a creator, I want to make sure that all content isn't too much for the eye and it all flows together nicely and smoothly.
  - As a creator, I want to ensure that once viewing my project from the homepage, the user is not confused by the purpose of the project.
  - As a creator, I want users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their
  personal goals

*User Stories*

  - As a first-time user, I want the game to be easy and simple to understand and play.
  - As a first-time user, I want to be able to play the game across any device.
  - As a first-time user, I want to have clear instructions so I know how to play the game.
  - As a first-time user, I want to be able to contact the developer with any questions.

Once establishing both creator and user stories, my goals for my project were clear as I had an evident idea of what users will be expecting of the project game.

#Scope-

This project is a memory matching game that allows you to keep track of your score and moves.

1. The landing, play and contact page share the same simple design, yet correspond perfectly with Nintendo's retro game colour scheme. The simple to use, neat display offers the users easy navigation and total control.

2. The home page is an introduction to the game site. It includes a main image and a short and simple summary of the game and its instructions. It has a brightly coloured play button to direct the user to the game page.

3. The play page greets the user with two main buttons; the play button and the instructions button.
  - As the user clicks the play button, the game grid is instantly shown alongside their score, moves and reset button.
  - The user must choose 2 cards at a time and see if they are a match. If they are, the cards stay facing up, otherwise they are    flipped back down and the user must try to remember where the colours are.
  - Once all of the matches are found, a congratulations message appears and the user is able to reset the game and replay.

4. A contact page to allow the users to contact the developer with questions and suggestions.

##Requirements-
- The game can be played across all devices and screen sizes.
- The site is responsive.
- Buttons and links are clear and easy to click on.
- The navigation bar is always present(A menu for smaller screen sizes.)
- A functioning reset button so the user doesn't have to exit the browser to play again.

#Structure-

As my game characters were based on Nintendo's Mario games, i wanted to make a clear connection to the colours Nintendo uses within their games. This is done to bring the nostalgic feel to my project and incorporate the Mario magic that I, and Nintendo fans feel.
As I was already familiar with the Nintendo bright and fun colour scheme, i went ahead and chose these as my main colours:

- Light Blue #60AAF6
- Dark Blue #2323FB
- Yellow #FFDA44
- Red #FD0000

These bright, primary colours create a fun and explorative environment for the game. To enhance this playful theme throughout my project, i decided to use a moving pixel cloud background to mimic the moving sky that the retro Mario games had.

**Typography**

- Segoe UI

I decided to use one main front throughout the project and use a variation of font weights to offer a diverse yet simple look that is easy to read for the eye.

The navigation bar and footer and consistent throughout all pages to keep a clean and simple look in order for the user to feel familiar to where features are placed across the site. As the screen size becomes smaller, the navigation turns into a hamburger menu with a toggle feature, allowing the user to interact with when they want the menu to appear.

Use of relevant images on the landing and play page to fill in empty spaces and be appealing to the eye.

Within my project, i used bootstrap's framework and libraries to ensure my site is responsive and has a clean finish.

#Skeleton-

As part of my planning process, creating mockups helped me to visualize my ideas and see if they would be pleasing to the eye. These are my initial conceptual ideas:
