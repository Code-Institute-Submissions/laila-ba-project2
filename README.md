Milestone Project2 - Memory Toad Game

##Introduction-

Welcome to my second Milestone Project called *'Memory Toad'* which will be showcasing my skills, learning and understanding that I have learnt through the course so far while being implemented into a front-end, user centric memory game.

Within this README, I will cover all the steps and planning processes used while creating this project, including where I gained my inspiration from and my main focuses as the developer. You can view my live project [here](https://laila-ba.github.io/Project2/)

During the planning process, I found the Elements of User-Experience to be helpful as it allowed me to keep in mind what the user wants and how my piece should respond to their actions. These elements are broken into 5 key stages:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

I began to conduct some research on what features a conventional memory game included in order to further understand what users would be expecting. I came up with a list of goals that I would want to achieve for my project:

*Creator stories*

- As a creator, I want to create a positive user response throughout the project, allowing the user to find exactly what they are looking for.
- As a creator, I want to make sure that all content isn't too much for the eye and it all flows together nicely and smoothly.
- As a creator, I want to ensure that once viewing my project from the homepage, the user is not confused by the purpose of the project.
- As a creator, I want users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their
personal goals
