Milestone Project2 - Memory Toad Game

##Introduction-

Welcome to my second Milestone Project called *'Memory Toad'* which will be showcasing my skills, learning and understanding that I have learnt through the course so far while being implemented into a front-end, user centric memory game.

Within this README, I will cover all the steps and planning processes used while creating this project, including where I gained my inspiration from and my main focuses as the developer. You can view my live project [here](https://laila-ba.github.io/Project2/)

During the planning process, I found the Elements of User-Experience to be helpful as it allowed me to keep in mind what the user wants and how my piece should respond to their actions. These elements are broken into 5 key stages:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

Once I had decided that I wanted to create a simple and fun memory game, I began to conduct some research on what features a conventional memory game included
